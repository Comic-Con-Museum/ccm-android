# Comic-Con Museum Android App

The Comic-Con Museum Android App enhances audience experience and access through in-gallery augmented reality, game-based progress tracking, and ability to explore an extensive library of exhibition content.

The Museum's app is currently comprised of two components:
Native Android, and [Unity/Vuforia AR](TODO). This is the repo for the Native Android component.

Check out our [contribution guidelines](TODO) to get started.

Once we're live, you can find the app in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store).
