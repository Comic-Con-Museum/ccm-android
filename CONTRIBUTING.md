## Contributing

### Getting Started

Install [Android Studio 3.X.X](https://developer.android.com/studio/) (we recommend the latest stable version). If you're unfamiliar with Android development, take a chance to familiarize yourself with the Google-recommended design and development practices.

Clone the repository locally and you should be good to go!

### Contributing Process

If you want to begin working on an issue in any of the projects, please assign the issue to yourself, and move the issue to the 'In Progress' section of the board. Once complete, open a Pull Request and reference the issue.

If you want to contribute work that is not listed on a project board, first discuss your desired changes in the Ideas project. Anyone can move ideas into the awaiting approval section when their idea is ready to be approved by a team member. After approval we can begin implementation.

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a Pull Request and reference an existing issue if need be. Include any screenshots/gifs of front-end changes.
2. Include a brief explaination of any new dependencies. Be sure to check that the dependency is being actively maintained, and will not bloat the app. Please avoid using Java over Kotlin for contributions. If you absolutely need to use Java, please include a reason why.
3. Request approval from a team member.
4. Once the pull request is approved, you can merge it. If you do not have permissions, let a team member know they can merge it on your behalf.
